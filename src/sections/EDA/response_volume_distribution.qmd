### Response Volume Distribution

The distribution of the number of replies per tweet was visualized using
a histogram with a log-transformed x-axis to accommodate skewness. The
analysis revealed that while most tweets received a low number of
replies, a significant portion experienced high engagement, indicating
the presence of outliers and overdispersion.

```{r include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
#library(ggplot2)

# Calculate reply counts for each tweet
reply_counts <- tweets %>%
  group_by(tweet_id) %>%
  summarise(reply_count = n())

# Plot histogram of reply counts with log transformation
ggplot(reply_counts, aes(x = reply_count)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = 'log1p') +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Reply Counts", x = "Number of Replies", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
