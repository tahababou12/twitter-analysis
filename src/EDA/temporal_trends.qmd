### Temporal Trends

Analysis revealed that response volumes and sentiments vary
significantly by time of day and day of the week. Tweets sent during
peak hours (9 AM to 5 PM) tended to receive more replies, suggesting
that support teams are more active during these periods. Additionally,
weekends showed different engagement patterns compared to weekdays.
